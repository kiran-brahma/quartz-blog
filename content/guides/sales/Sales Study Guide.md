## Introduction

At the start of this year, I decided to embark on a journey to understand the ins and outs of sales from the grounds up. I am building this study guide to help me to organise and solidify my knowledge related to sales along the way. 

Think of this as a living document â€“ a snapshot of my learning process that anyone can refer and learn along the way. If you're new to sales or looking for a refresher, I hope you find this guide helpful!

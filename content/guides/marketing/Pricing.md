## Pricing Strategies and Considerations

- **Objective:** The most important objective of marketing is to **extract value from customers via an effective pricing strategy**.
    
- **Cost-Based Pricing:**
    
    - **Popular:** This is the most popular pricing strategy because managers generally have a better idea of their cost structure than the value of their products and services. It is also appropriate when many people inside the organization are involved in setting prices.
    - **Disadvantages:** However, too much focus on costs invites inefficiency and can lead to a failure to capitalize on market changes. This approach may not be aligned with different customer segments.
- **Value-Based Pricing:**
    
    - This strategy involves estimating customer value, which can be done through various methods such as calculating Value-in-Use, simulating buying experiences, utilizing the De-compositional approach (Conjoint), or estimating Brand Equity.
    - **Value Creation and Extraction:** Effective usage of the 4Ps in pricing emphasizes **value extraction through pricing (1P) and value creation through Place, Promotion, and Product (3Ps).**
- **Reference Price:** This refers to the price level of either a competing product or a substitute/alternative product and serves as a benchmark for customers.
    
- **Channel Margins:** In industries with multiple channel members (e.g., imported beer), it is important to understand channel margins and pricing practices. This involves understanding the markup applied at each stage of the distribution chain from manufacturer to consumer.
    
- **Price Premium (Relative Price):** This metric measures how a brand's price compares to its competition. It is calculated as the percentage by which a product's price exceeds (or falls short of) a benchmark price (e.g., average price paid, price of a direct competitor).
    
- **Reservation Price:** This is the maximum amount a customer is willing to pay for a product, reflecting their individual perceived value.
    
- **Percent Good Value:** This measures the proportion of customers who perceive a product to be a "good value" at a specific price, meaning its price is at or below their reservation price.
    
- **Optimal Price:** This is the price that yields the greatest possible contribution or profit. The optimal price for a linear demand function is the midpoint between the maximum reservation price and the variable cost to produce that product.
    
- **Price Discrimination/Tailoring:** This involves charging different prices to different customers based on their willingness to pay, price sensitivity, or cost to serve. Examples include coupons, rebates, and discounts. **Price tailoring can increase profits but must be done within legal and logistical constraints.** You may want to research legal regulations regarding price discrimination, such as the Robinson-Patman Act in the United States.
    
- **Economic Value to the Customer (EVC):** To encourage customers to switch to your product, you need to provide them with surplus value that at least matches what they receive from their current product. This means offering a value proposition that exceeds the customer's perceived price.

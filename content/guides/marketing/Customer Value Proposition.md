## Customer Value Proposition Development Guide

### Section 1: Defining Customer Value

- **Key Topics:**
    
    - **Customer Value:** Customer value is the worth in monetary terms of the technical, economic, service, and social benefits a customer company receives in exchange for the price it pays for a market offering. The equation: (Value**s** - Price**s**) - (Value**a** - Price**a**) represents this, where **s** represents the supplier's offering and **a** represents the next best alternative. The customer's incentive to purchase a supplier's offering must exceed its incentive to pursue the next best alternative for a purchase to occur.
    - **Value Elements:** Value elements are anything that affect the costs and benefits of the offering in the customer's business. These may be technical, economic, service, or social, and vary in their tangibility.
    - **Types of Customer Value Propositions:** There are three types of value propositions:
        - **All Benefits:** The supplier lists all the benefits its offering might deliver to target customers. This is the simplest approach, but it may include benefits that are not relevant to the customer, or that are already offered by competitors.
        - **Favorable Points of Difference:** The supplier explicitly recognizes the customer has an alternative and focuses on the benefits that differentiate its offering. This requires more knowledge about the competitive landscape than the all benefits approach.
        - **Resonating Focus:** This is the gold standard for value propositions. The supplier focuses on the one or two points of difference that deliver the greatest value to target customers, demonstrates and documents the value, and communicates in a way that conveys a sophisticated understanding of the customer's business priorities.
- **Fundamental Questions:**
    
    - How is value defined and measured in business markets?
    - What are the key benefits and costs that customers consider when evaluating a market offering?
    - What are the three types of value propositions, and what are the potential pitfalls of each?
    - What are some examples of value propositions that resonate with customers?

### Section 2: Understanding the Customer

- **Key Topics:**
    
    - **Customer Needs:** What are the unmet needs and pain points that customers are experiencing?
    - **Customer Value Drivers:** What aspects of a product or service are most important to customers when making a purchasing decision?
    - **Competitive Alternatives:** What are the other options available to customers, including making the product themselves or using a competitor's offering?
    - **Customer Value Research:** How can a supplier conduct customer value research to gain insights into customer needs, value drivers, and competitive alternatives?
- **Fundamental Questions:**
    
    - How can a supplier identify and understand the unmet needs of its customers?
    - What are the different methods for conducting customer value research, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
    - How can a supplier use customer value research to develop insights that inform its value proposition?

### Section 3: Constructing a Winning Value Proposition

    - **Demonstrating Value:** How can a supplier demonstrate and document the value of its offering?
    - **Communicating Value:** How can a supplier communicate its value proposition in a way that is clear, concise, and persuasive?

    - How can a supplier ensure that its value proposition is aligned with its overall business strategy?

### Section 4: Substantiating the Value Proposition

- **Key Topics:**
    
    - **Value Word Equations:** How can a supplier use value word equations to quantify the cost savings or added value its offering provides?
    - **Value Case Histories:** How can a supplier create compelling value case histories that document the results achieved by its customers?
    - **Value Calculators:** How can a supplier develop value calculators that enable customers to estimate the potential cost savings or added value they would receive?
- **Fundamental Questions:**
    
    - What data is needed to create a value word equation, and how can this data be collected?
    - What are the key elements of a persuasive value case history?

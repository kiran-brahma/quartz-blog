A **customer** is simply a **person or business that buys a product or service to meet their needs.**

In today's business world, you can broadly identify your customers in two ways:

- **Non-Contractual:** These customers make one-time purchases. You can track them by how recently they bought from you (e.g., a six-month customer purchased within the last six months).

In the current business landscape, defining your customers clearly and consistently is crucial for several reasons:

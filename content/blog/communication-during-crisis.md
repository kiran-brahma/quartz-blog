## Key takeaways

1.  **Act swiftly:** Waiting is not an option during crises; prompt action is necessary.
2.  **Transparency builds trust:** Acknowledge issues, take ownership, and provide clear context for solutions.
3.  **Address concerns directly:** Avoid vagueness and excuses; offer immediate solutions where possible.
4.  **Keep it human:** Personalise responses, avoid generic templates and demonstrate genuine investment in resolving issues.
5.  **Stick to facts:** Avoid spreading unconfirmed information; maintain honesty and clarity in communication.
6.  **Proactive planning:** Create protocols and contingency plans to prevent future crises, equipping the team for effective problem resolution.
Let's face it: even the best plans can't account for every unexpected crisis. I've personally encountered several, and transparency proved to be my lifeboat while navigating them.

## Introduction
In 2019, after my father's sudden passing, I took the helm of his five-year-old business. Still learning the ropes, I was hit with a customer termination notice due to poor service. This potential 10% business loss was a wake-up call. I needed a communication strategy to save the day.

## **Acting Fast, Even Without All the Answers**

Ideally, I'd have preferred complete information before contacting the customer. But waiting wasn't an option. I reached out with the details I had. While I couldn't answer every question, my prompt action demonstrated our commitment to resolving the issue.


## Transparency: Building Trust

As customers, we all dislike businesses that avoid problems, sweeping them under the rug. I acknowledged the customer's concerns, taking ownership rather than making excuses.

I sent across an email, wherein I provided clear context on why such issues occurred and how we plan to resolve them. I assured them of our commitment to addressing any unknown issues that may further arise during this period with full transparency

## Addressing Concerns Head-On: No Beating Around the Bush

Let's be honest – vagueness and excuses only frustrate customers. I tackled concerns head-on, offering immediate solutions for smaller issues and requesting more time for complex ones. For example, they flagged slow response times from my team. I assured them that until my team could meet their needs, I'd personally handle all issues.

By confronting concerns directly and demonstrating our commitment to them, we showed the customer we valued their business.

## Keeping it Human

We've all experienced soul-crushing automated messages when we try to file a complaint with any bank in India. This is a key reason why, for the past decade, I stuck with American Express, despite lower acceptance, impressed with their human-centric customer service.

Adopting a similar approach, I focussed on ensuring that every email sent across wasn't some generic template-type response. They were written to ensure that someone genuinely invested in resolving the issues was responding to all concerns raised. Even minor concerns received personalised attention, ensuring they weren't lost in a support ticketing system.


## Sticking to the Facts: Avoiding Misinformation

Our established five-year relationship with the customer gave us a foundation of trust. However, some complaints went against our usual experience, raising questions. While my team suspected internal politics at the customer's company might be at play, I opted not to speculate. Spreading such unconfirmed information could have sown confusion among the over 100 personnel engaged in the customer's premises.

Therefore, I stuck to verifiable facts in all communication, keeping things clear, concise, and honest. Over two weeks, using this consistent approach, we weathered the storm and regained their trust.

## Proactive Planning: Preventing Future Storms

This experience highlighted the need for internal systems to prevent similar crises. On deeper investigation, I discovered a lack of clear protocols, procedures, and contingency plans – the root cause of the issue.

Over the following weeks, I focused on creating a "playbook" for future situations, including case studies, and how to respond to common queries or service deficiency complaints, equipping my team to resolve problems before they escalate.

## Conclusion

Remember, transparency is the ultimate crisis management tool. By being honest, acting swiftly, and keeping it human, you can navigate any storm that comes your way. Stay calm and collected, and you'll emerge stronger on the other side.

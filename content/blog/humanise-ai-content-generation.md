## Introduction

AI Writing fails due to adopting a generic approach to content generated. Suppose you need to use AI to generate good-quality content that will serve as your first draft.

If your initial draft is already prepared, then you can take the assistance of AI to [[ai-prompts|improve your writing]]
Below is a list of options available to generate your first good-quality draft. I have provided the final prompt I use when I am researching for a new blog post.

## Persona

- Share the link or text of the article you have written
- Prompt
	- Analyse my tone, how I form sentences and paragraphs, the level of details I use in my explanation, the amount of humour I use, how often I ask the reader questions, the readability level I use, the vocabulary I use, and the level of emotion I convey in my writing
	- Give me a 250-word summary of what you have learnt
	- Based on the writing style analysed from the provided article, create content titled (Topic) at (X words). Ensure that the new content strictly adheres to the author's writing style in terms of tone, structure, and approach as identified in the analysis
 
### Result
- Strongly accepted as human by most readers
- Lacks personal experience 

## Personal exp

To improve the personal prompt, we include further information about the writer to improve the overall quality of the draft

- Share a link on your profile where you share your experience and stories that qualify you as an author for the content you write
- Share a personal opinion on the topic you are planning to write.
- The integration should be subtle at a level of 2 on 10 out of 10

### Result
- Strongly accepted as human by most readers


## Perplexity

AI generates content that is so common that most AI detectors and humans can know if it's written by humans or AI with a glance. We use the below prompt to avoid the common AI glitches

- Ai uses words that most humans don’t use
- Don’t always the most natural words. Ensure that the following words are not used more than 3 times: unique, ensure and utmost
- Before outputting the content, review it for the following words and rewrite the sentences with alternative: meticulous, meticulously, navigating, complexity, realm, bespoke, tailored, towards, underpins, ever-changing, ever-evolving, the world of, not only, seeking more than just, designed to enhance, it’s not merely, our suite, it is advisable, daunting, in the heart of, when it comes to, in the realm of, amongst, unlock the secrets, unveil the secrets and robust
- Score is 6.5

## Burstiness

AI generates content that is almost of similar sentence length, unlike how humans write, so we need to rectify this error

**Prompt**
- Ensure heterogeneous paragraphs. Ensure heterogeneous sentence length. Stick to primarily short, straightforward sentences


## Fact Insertion

Most AI models have a cut-off date, so they are not updated on the latest knowledge, so you need to provide some latest facts to the model to improve quality of content generated

- Share key facts that are needed for the writing
- - Use [perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) to generate a list of facts to use them

**Prompt**: 
Please use these facts when creating content titled (Title) within (x words)


## UnFluffing

AI adds a lot of useless statements when generating content, so we need to inform it to avoid this

**Prompt**

* Don’t include any fluff when producing content. 
* Each Sentence should provide value to the overall goal of the content piece. 
* Follow this guideline strictly


## Audience Targeting

Every content we generate is targeted towards a specific audience, so if we provide such information to the AI model, it will generate content that caters to our readers. To gather information, you can analyse the top articles on Google, which can help in providing details for the prompt

**Prompt**
- My target audience has the following characteristics
	- Insert demographics such % of males and females and age range
	- Tone preferences such as professional or students and what type of content they like to read
	- Reading level preferences such as 10th grade or college grade or something similar

### Sample Personal Beliefs

Working in a startup provides learning opportunities that are hard to come by elsewhere. In my view, if you are comfortable with frequent changes, I would suggest working for 2-3 years to set the stage for better future career prospects. The problems you face in a startup are multiplied when compared to working for a conventional MNC, while also helping you learn what not to do with the least career impact. I would certainly recommend conversing with a few individuals to get a sense of the company and even the team you will be joining, to avoid future shocks.


## Conclusion

At the outset, it appears that the effort to generate your unique prompt is cumbersome, it's a one-time investment. The process allows you to develop a good outline for your content, allowing you to sweat the details before you hit publish.

AI-generated content is still pretty poor and many people state that content seems a little off. Hence, consider such content as a means to get the ball rolling rather than as a finished product. Do remember that even the smartest of us need the assistance of others to [[standing on shoulders of giants|build anything further]].

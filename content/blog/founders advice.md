## Introduction

> "A favourite theory of mine is that no _occurrence_ is sole and solitary, but is merely a repetition of a thing which has happened before, and perhaps often."
> - Mark Twain

We have all heard of the adage that "History Repeats itself". If history has lessons to impart, they are found across multiple recurring patterns <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_recurrence">1</a></sup>. In the same vein, rather than trying to figure out everything by ourselves when starting a new business, take time to read [[advise-filter|what others]] who have been through the journey say about it. 

By tapping into others' experiences - failures and successes - we can fasten our learning curve while avoiding the obvious mistakes. This blog post is a collection of advice from startup founders across domains and growth stages. 

## Team Building

 * Hiring Great Product Managers
    - See if they can lead with authority
    - Takes blame but gives credit away
    - Ability to make decisions with limited information
    - Intense preparation ability
    - Methodical on how to recover from mistakes or failures
    - Operates optimally under intense pressure

- Stop evaluating people based on potential. You have 2 possible growth trajectories for people
    - Super Star - Those who provide outstanding performance but not always reliable
    - RockStar - These provide you with stable and excellent performance
    - You need to match people according to the role

-  Avoid working with risk-averse mentors. You need to work with those who have seen it all

- As a startup founder, focus your efforts on moving your team from generalists to team of specialists
    - Let people identify their area of interest and allow them to develop their speciality in the same
    - Provide freedom for the team to keep considering newer ideas outside their speciality always but you should be clear on what each member will be a specialist on
    - As a founder, focus your energies on what your organisation needs to be focused on and needs tech capability

- Identify the right COO.
    - Undertake the following self-evaluation
        - What am I drawn to and enjoy doing? Note them down and observe how you structure your day
        - What do I avoid or laze on doing? List down all areas that you don’t enjoy doing
        - What do I wish I knew? Identify areas you need to improve and currently lack. The COO needs to guide you in this area
    - COO needs to complement the CEO, so ensure that the person selected enjoys doing what you avoid and can train you in areas you want to improve. The COO is not supposed to be the CEO's babysitter and lacks the CEO's ego.
- Don't hire data analysts who lack clear business context as they will tend to work in silos and provide theoretical solutions that won't add any business value
## Product Market Fit

- One of the most subtle forms of determination is your ability to get a grip on an idea or be persistent about it. 
	- Focus on repeating what you do every week and remind yourself why you are doing the same. 
	- Clearly define and explain your success metrics

- Demo your products to young, old and drunk
    - You can only then build products that are simple to use
    - Ask them what this is for to get a sense in the simplest sense

- Don’t fall into the trap of developing [[product-market-fit|highly customisable solutions]] as this needs a lot of data, which we mostly don’t have access to. Too much personalisation leads to steep opportunity costs. Focus more on key problems to be solved rather than getting stuck in personalisation solutions
* To build features for users they need, you need to observe them in their daily job. You need to see for a long period to arrive at a clear pattern on your observations
    - Focus your efforts on seeing what’s being done manually by overqualified people for any task as this area is ripe for a new feature that saves time. You need to observe for multiple days to avoid building a narrow solutions that does not benefit the customer
- When dealing with multiple trade-offs to be made. Let everyone work on making the best possible outcome for the one feature or aspect they are responsible for. This way you are likely to end up making the best possible product -tradeoff*

- Develop your go-to-market strategy by identifying if your product is bought or sold. You need to identify if Sales or Marketing is to lead it. You can use the following attributes to arrive at a bought or sold matrix for your product

## Productivity

- Start every day from zero.
    - Reset your odometer to 0 at the start of each ride, as going from 0 to 50 is better than going from 510 to 560.
    - This helps improve focus, as you are starting from scratch and don't feel complacent.
    - Push forward for progress, no matter how small, as it is better than none.
- Schedule solo clarity meetings to do [[essentialism|focused intentional work]]. The agenda for such meetings needs to include
    - List down broader team or organisation top priorities
    - Check if personal priorities are aligned with organisational one
    - Check for Data/info that requires a shift in priorities
    - Check your time allocations, and meetings based on your priorities. Cancel if any don’t meet them for the week
    - Keep adjusting your work calendar based on priorities

## Decision Making

- Decision evaluation: Always evaluate any decision amongst various options you make using the following attributes
    - Benefits
    - Costs
    - Mitigation: Focus most on this before arriving at a decision
- Develop a [[quick-decision|framework]] to take decisions quickly
- When in doubt about any big decisions, utilise hypothesis trees to arrive at it. 
	- List down verifiable independent hypotheses or facts for the main hypothesis. 
	- Allows you to focus on areas of debate and validate each hypothesis

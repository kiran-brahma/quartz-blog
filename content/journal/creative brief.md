## Introduction

Once your business has a [[note-on-marketing-strategy|marketing plan]] prepared, one key element is to ensure that the final communication captures the essence of your plan. Most of us work with outside marketing agencies for the development of creatives and content for your customer communication. 

A creative brief is a document that serves as the roadmap for your marketing activities. It is a concise document that captures your marketing goals, target audience, key messaging and final deliverables. The total brief needs to be within 2 pages at best

This document provides everyone with clarity during the development of marketing materials, while at the same time allowing you to put your thoughts and vision on paper

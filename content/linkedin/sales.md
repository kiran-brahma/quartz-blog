A few weeks ago, I was pitching my company's services to a senior operations leader. I explained that his existing vendor had made false statements and presented all possible facts to validate my claim. However, despite my efforts, the person was unwilling to trust my assertion, so I gave up.

Last week, I spoke to my friend who had given me the reference. My friend informed me that the current system adopted by the vendor was vetted by the senior leader for implementation. My attempt to state that it was incorrect was a grave error on my part.

This incident made me realise that it's difficult to convince people that they are wrong. It's better to invest energy in framing your pitch so that they arrive at the same conclusion without feeling like they are being told that they are wrong.

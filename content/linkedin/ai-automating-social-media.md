I recently came across an Youtube Video demonstrating how AI can effortlessly automate posting across social media platforms

While this hack is incredibly convenient, it got me thinking:  
"How much trust can I place any post moving forward?"  
  
It is likely that soon most of my feed across platforms will be flooded  AI-generated content. Given how fast AI is advancing, soon I wont be able to make out if a post I am reading now was actually written by a person or not.  
  
While AI is an amazing tool for drafting or refining what i write, however relying on it completely will remove the insight or thoughtfulness that made some articles or post I enjoyed reading

 [The Medallion Fund](https://lnkd.in/dN3Cm2jX)) is one of the most successful hedge funds in history. It has generated annual returns of over 66% before fees, and over 39% after fees over 30 years.

However, no one knows its trading strategy and the fund is only open to a select few.

Analysts have tried to dissect the Medallion Fund's trading strategy but to no avail. The fund's managers are notoriously secretive, and they have never disclosed their secret sauce.

The Medallion Fund's secrecy is a reminder if one knows how to beat the market, you would be keeping the secret sauce to yourself.

Medallion Fund highlights the fact that many of the financial influencers themselves don't know the secret sauce to beat the market. Promises of high returns with limited risk are often stated but the truth is high returns always come with a higher risk so it's important to do your research and only invest in products that you understand and believe in.

Now with SEBI stepping in to regulate finfluencers is a welcome development. As stated in the article, 100% compliance is not possible. Even a slight improvement in compliance can have a large impact on most.

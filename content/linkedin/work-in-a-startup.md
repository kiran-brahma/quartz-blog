With all the news on startups about funding winter and layoffs, startup jobs seem riskier than usual lately.

While not all startups have resorted to layoffs, before joining one, you need to dig deeper before accepting offers.

Apart from understanding your role, team and culture, you must understand the company's financial health. No amount of culture or mission can save a financially unviable company.

So when exploring an opportunity, do understand on following:

- How are expenses funded - self or venture-backed?
- If venture-backed, what's the cash burn rate and time before needing more funds?
- Is the valuation trending up or down? Decreasing valuations mean increased investor pressure and likely layoffs.
- Is the business operationally profitable? Growth needs to improve sustainability, not cause it to implode
- What's the employee termination policy?
- Finally, ask yourself: would you still want to work there if it fails? The experience of working with a great team is often the biggest draw - if that remains true, the risks are worth it.

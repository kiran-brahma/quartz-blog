Over the past year, I've been juggling between multiple apps whenever I needed AI assistance to improve my text or checking for grammatical errors.  
  
To simplify the process, I started paying for [Notion](https://www.linkedin.com/company/notionhq/) AI. Now [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/) keeps reminding me to shift to its new AI plan to use across all its apps.

However, with the launch of [Apple](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple/)'s AI tools, most of these AI benefits will now be free across its products. If the tools do work as claimed in their keynote, it will certainly tempt me, to upgrade my phone.  
  
It appears most investors share a similar sentiment, as Apple's stock price has shot up by 15% in the past 2 days.

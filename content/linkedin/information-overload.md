When looking for information on any subject, I am overwhelmed with the vast amount of information available at my fingertips. Now I can gather information on any topic with a simple query to an AI Chatbot  
  
In the past, family and friends used to seek my advice on what tech product to buy. Today, when I am asked the same question, I tell them to just google it but they just say it is too much of an information overload, making it tough to decide.  
  
It is time to take control of information intake, curating it from specific sources, as mostly the information overload has made it harder than easier for me to make an informed decision.

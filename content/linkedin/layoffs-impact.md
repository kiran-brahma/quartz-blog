Layoffs have different impacts on men and women. Men often view it as a major setback, feeling insecure until they find new employment. Women, however, may take the opportunity to pursue personal commitments or return to the workforce later and their job loss is generally taken less seriously by friends and family than men's.

I haven't been laid off or raised venture funding, yet I still recall how people reacted when I chose to quit my job and start something of my own. This transition wasn't widely discussed, yet I could easily sense the scepticism. Conversations shifted too; I was no longer seen as "the guy with a fat paycheck", but as a jobless person trying to make ends meet. 

Entrepreneurs are applauded, however only if you're among the fortunate few who receive funding; otherwise you're equated with someone unemployed and striving to earn until they get a job.

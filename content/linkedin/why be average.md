Let's face it: none of us enjoy being labelled as average, even in areas where we lack ability. We see images of people achieving great things, making us feel inadequate. But the truth is, it's perfectly fine to be average.

I find myself below average in many areas. Initially, it was a tough pill to swallow, but over time I've come to appreciate its merits.

For instance, I'm not a proficient cook, my writing skills are far from exceptional, I'm just average with numbers, and my running abilities are nothing to write home about. I'll never become a world-class chef, publish an award-winning book or claim a top position in a marathon race. Yet when needed, I can make an edible meal, draft clear emails, run 10km without gasping for air and navigate my company finances with ease.

In fact, over the years I have realised it's better to be [well-rounded than to be good at just one thing](https://hbr.org/2018/07/when-generalists-are-better-than-specialists-and-vice-versa) 

While achieving an average level of proficiency in a skill is attainable for most of us, becoming a true specialist requires us to dedicate time and effort that isn't feasible. I am content to be average in any skill or ability as I don't feel the need to invest substantial energy for marginal improvements over a long period.

Once I accepted that being average is okay - and most of us are average while excelling in a few areas - I no longer compare myself to exceptional people. Being average is fine, and may even be an advantage in today's world that values versatility.

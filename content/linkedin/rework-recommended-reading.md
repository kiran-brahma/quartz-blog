I read ReWork 5 years back, as I was starting my entrepreneurial journey. The book was quite different from the usual business books I read.

  [![Rework](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xM6l2IKJL._SY522_.jpg)](https://amzn.to/4c43r1v)
  
- Chapters written as blog posts, so can read from any topic
- Challenges the typical "scale fast to raise funding" ethos
- Practical advice on overcoming everyday business challenges
- Ideas relevant even today, offering insights whenever I read it again
- The author at times appears over-confident, pushing ideas that worked for their specific situations

  
A recommended read for anyone seeking a quick read on practical advice with minimal fluff.

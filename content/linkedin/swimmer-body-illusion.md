I returned to Delhi in 2016 after a crazy year in Mumbai that hit my health hard due to my lifestyle choices. I gained over 20 KGs in just a year. When I saw myself in the mirror, all 98 kgs of me, I knew it was time to get back on track health-wise.

Keen to shed weight without resorting to diets, which I wouldn't be able to follow in the long run, I sought ideas from my friends. Many suggested swimming since swimmers are usually the fittest athletes out there. I contemplated choosing a location where I could sign up for classes before work. However, none met my requirements, so dropped the idea. I decided to explore running as it seemed easier based on my work schedule.

As I researched further, I discovered that swimming and running have similar calorie expenditure, with running slightly ahead. Most professional swimmer's exceptional physiques are not solely from swimming, but also from rigorous weight and circuit training as part of their regular training regimes

**This is similar** to how we attribute someone's success to their college. We often forget about the demanding admission process, which ensures that only the most promising candidates get in.

**Running did help me lose weight, as I eventually shed over 20 kg after 9 months of running over 750 kilometres**

Mostly in life, we tend to make choices based on the outcomes we observe. The results we're observing might not be because of the factor we're focusing on. So, before we commit to something, it's smarter to gather a bunch of information about all possible factors involved. This way, we can steer clear of the mistake of tying results to just one cause and start making more informed decisions.

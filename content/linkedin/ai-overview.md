**SEO: Google just changed the course...again.**

After 4 months of optimising my company's website for "Hire Security Guards," I finally started seeing traction and improved rankings for specific keywords. Then, Google decided to shake things up (again!) with AI Overviews and AI-organised search results.

Until now, my [[humanise-ai-content-generation|SEO]] strategy focused on:
- **Developing content** that ranks high for targeted keywords.
- **Attracting customers** through improved search rankings.
- **Hoping** those interested would reach out.

But now AI-organised search results will change the game:
- It's **not just about search rankings** anymore.
- My business needs to be in the **top recommendations.**

Soon, leads will only come if Google AI recommends my security services as the go-to choice.

Frankly, it's incredibly frustrating. Google keeps changing its rules, and I'm constantly scrambling to keep up. Now I need to adapt to the fact that fewer customers will be interacting less with my website, as most interested will complete the call-to-action directly within the AI Overview results.

**P.S. Anyone else feeling the need for change due to Google's AI Overviews? How are you adapting your SEO strategy? I'd love to learn more about your experiences and insights you have!**

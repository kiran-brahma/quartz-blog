Every other day I keep reading why EVs are better than conventional cars, but most people sharing their insight don't own an EV and their ideas are based on expert opinion rather than personal experience.

After driving my MG ZS EV for 6000+ km over the last 4 months, here's what I learned:

- In winter, expect a lower range of around 20-25%.
- Since I do 99% of my driving within city limits, the range allows me to commute for 4-5 days without any worries. I made a trip to Chandigarh, requiring me to pause for 30 minutes for a recharge, during which I took a break for food. Most joints that we generally pause have an EV charging, so it wasnâ€™t a challenge per se.
- To maximise regenerative braking, you need to adjust your driving style. Overall, driving an EV is similar to driving a conventional car, with the notable exception of the car's quietness.

If you're interested in buying an electric vehicle but are hesitant due to the high cost, here's how I made my calculations to arrive at my final decision

Overall, the cost worked out practically the same for me, but keep in mind that for EV tyres may last 10% less than in a petrol car. I am confident that over the next 5 years, fuel costs will rise faster than electricity costs. Once the loan payment is over, the savings will accumulate even faster.

If you're considering buying a new car, do your maths to see if an EV makes sense for you. However, do bear in mind current options are limited but over 2-3 years, options should be much more than as on date

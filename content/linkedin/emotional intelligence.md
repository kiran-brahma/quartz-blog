Emotional intelligence, not intelligence, really sets you apart. Research shows that a higher IQ can lead to better job prospects. But, it is emotional intelligence that distinguishes top performers from the rest of the team. Everyone in your team has the minimum IQ required for their roles, so intelligence can't bring much more value as there is a maximum threshold that adds benefit, and beyond this point, further improvements won't be beneficial.

**Key EQ Traits:**
* Self-awareness
* Self-regulation
* Motivation
* Empathy
* Social skills

Emotional intelligence can be improved with effort, and it can be more advantageous than increasing intelligence. Therefore, focus more on developing your EQ traits, since relying solely on IQ only yields diminishing returns once you reach the average level necessary for success in your current role.

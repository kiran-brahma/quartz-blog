In 2011, iPhone 4 shook up the camera world as it became the most used camera on Flickr. In 2023, over 50% of all photos posted on Flickr are those captured by Smartphones

However today, the most sought-after camera is not an iPhone but a Fujifilm X100VI

- Sold out within hours
- Backordered for over a year with scalpers selling it at 2-3X its retail price.

The Fuji's X Series

- Launched in 2011 and initially labelled as expensive jewellery
- Found a loyal following among street photographers and enthusiasts
- Fuji leveraging its expertise in colour science, incorporated the cameras with Film Simulation modes, outputting great photos with a vintage feel.

Lately, there has been a trend of people, especially amongst GenZ seeking an unpolished experience against the smoothness of modern technology.

The scarcity of the X100V in the market, coupled with its ability to evoke nostalgia led to a cult status within the social media, leading to its current craze.

**Key Takeaway: 
Never underestimate the power of niche markets, catering to specific user needs.**

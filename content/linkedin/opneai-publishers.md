AI's capability depends on the content it can access. Now [OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/) plans to pay publishers to access the latest content while giving them better exposure in its responses.  
  
Now if a publisher signs up, they  
- Get paid  
- Improve their brand exposure  
- Shape future responses to their Liking

AI [[Mental Model|Bias]] is already a concern expressed due to biased training data but I expect it to move further down as many publishers [won't sign up](https://lnkd.in/gNU7AwM3) or are not eligible. Those who sign up will have an edge in Search and brand perception over others.  
  
It will be interesting to see how [OpenAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/) manages the program while trying to reduce bias in [ChatGPT](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chatgptbyopenai/)'s responses

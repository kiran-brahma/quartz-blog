This weekend, I had the opportunity to interview prospective candidates for the ISB PGP program, which I always enjoy as I often meet interesting people with unique perspectives. During one conversation,I met a candidate with over 20 years of experience in the Navy who shared his decision-making process.

He emphasised that his key role in the Navy was to make quick decisions based on limited information. To avoid biases in these situations, he developed simple mental models to aid him. He acknowledged that he's not sure whether he made better decisions as a result, but his models did help him simplify problems and focus on the most important factors.

As he became more comfortable with his system, he was able to avoid overloading his brain with too many parameters. This allowed him to focus on the factors that mattered most and make quick, informed decisions.

We all have our decision-making systems, based on our past experiences, knowledge, and beliefs. However, we're often susceptible to common biases and beliefs, which can lead to poor decisions.

Adopting simple mental models has proven effective for me personally in avoiding biases and speeding up my decision-making process. If you're looking to improve your [[quick-decision|decision-making]], I encourage you to take a step back and develop your [[Mental Model|models]]. Incorporate basic checks to avoid past mistakes, and over time, your models will evolve, allowing you to make quick, good decisions. After all, that's what we're paid for.

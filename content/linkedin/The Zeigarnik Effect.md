In the 1920s, Bluma Zeigarnik made an intriguing observation about human behaviour. She noticed that waiters who took orders without writing them down remembered uncompleted orders better than the completed ones.

This observation led her to propose that unfinished tasks create a state of tension or cognitive dissonance within us, motivating us to finish what we've started.

This very phenomenon is evident when you log into any online platform. Most platforms highlight what's incomplete in our profiles in a simple list.

Whenever I encounter such a list, I feel compelled to complete it, striving for that satisfying "done" status.

This inherent quirk significantly impacts our daily productivity and focus. When I find myself staring at a lengthy to-do list, it becomes overwhelming, making it challenging to concentrate on the task at hand.

Over time, I've realised that even if I can't immediately complete a task, creating a plan of action or delegating it to someone else frees my mind from the constant worry about unfinished business.

So, the next time you're overwhelmed by a lengthy to-do list, take a moment to understand the psychological forces at play in your mind. Instead of feeling vexed by unfinished tasks, make plans for each one, and delegate whenever possible. This approach can lead to increased productivity and reduced mental clutter.

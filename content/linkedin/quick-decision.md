In my first job at L&T, my Project Manager always made quick decisions when faced with problems. While this led to prompt action from the team, it often resulted in issues that needed fixing later on. As a result, I started to believe that quick decisions cause more problems than they solve.

About a year into my job, I was overseeing project planning and client relations for the Construction of the T1-T3 Underpass at Delhi Airport. Taking longer than usual to deliberate on matters led to a pile-up of work and complaints from the field staff.

When asked about the issues, I tried to explain my thought process. I was then questioned if my approach caused fewer problems, to which I had no clear answer. I was instructed to make every decision within a day for the next two weeks, and then review the outcomes.

Later, when asked for feedback, I acknowledged that I had less work piling up and received positive feedback from the field team. My manager explained that in his 25+ year career, delaying decisions rarely leads to better outcomes. It is usually easier to course-correct than to delay. Teams appreciate not being left hanging for too long.

Over time, I have adopted a simple [[Mental Model|mental model]] that I came across in a letter from Warren Buffet. It suggests that whenever you feel conflicted about a decision, choose one direction and then ask yourself three questions:

1. How will you feel about it in 10 minutes from now?
2. How will you feel about it in 10 months?
3. How will you feel about it in 10 years?

Choose the option that you believe answers all three questions correctly.

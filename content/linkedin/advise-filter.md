Once you start your entrepreneurial journey, Advice floods in from all sides. The challenge is not finding good advice but sorting the useful from the well-meaning but irrelevant. 

Over time, I adopted a simple filter to cut through the noise:

**1. Industry Match:**

I currently run a B2B service company. Hence, advice from a B2C product maker might not add much value. However, advice from someone in the B2C service will be valuable. Filter out advice from others based on the stage of your business stage, the markets you serve, and your business model.

**2. Learn from Both Sides:**

Success stories are great but never sideline learning from those who failed. Often, both followed almost similar paths. By hearing from both, you can spot the real reasons for success (and avoid pitfalls) as most are not clear on why they [[swimmer-body-illusion|succeeded]]

**3. Business Basics:**

For core [[develop-basics|business principles]], follow the majority's advice. Unless you're sure you need an "out-of-the-box" approach, stick with the tried-and-true.

**4. Trust Your Gut (Mostly):**

Our brain has a built-in "[[Mental Model|decision-making model]]". If any advice clashes with your gut feeling, go with your instinct. You might need adjustments later ("[[superforecasting-the-art-and-science-of-prediction|course corrections]]"), hence ensure [[quick-decision|quick decisions]] to avoid too many delays

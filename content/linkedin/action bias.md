In football, about 30% of penalties target the middle, 40% the left, and 30% the right, with an average penalty save rate of around 26%<sup><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.645312/full">1</a></sup>

Goalkeepers can improve their chances of saving penalties by about 4%-5% by just staying put, but most prefer leaping to the left (44.4%) or right (49.3%). <sup><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/datablog/2023/aug/19/how-to-take-penalty-kicks-best-stats-football-soccer-data-womens-world-cup-2023">2</a></sup>

Now, if a penalty is scored hen the goalkeeper stays put. We can imagine the fans' outrage and their teammates' frustration with the goalkeeper. However, if the goalkeeper dives, even if the penalty is scored, none raise a complaint as it is understood that predicting where to dive is challenging. Now if the penalty is saved, the goalkeeper's actions are met with praise. Hence, we can see why in 95% of cases, goalkeepers choose to dive rather than just stay put.

This parallel extends to most of our professional lives, where individuals who prioritise immediate action receive applause over those who prefer thorough evaluation before making a move.

While [[changes|prompt action]] is sometimes necessary, taking a moment to reflect can lead to better results. Nonetheless, recognition typically gravitates toward those who act swiftly rather than those who deliberate.

Even when we instinctively sense that waiting a bit longer might yield better results, most of us are inclined toward action. When our actions lead to failure, it can be easily attributed to uncertainty and external factors, clearing ourselves of any blame.

Ideally, careful contemplation should precede action, but quick action often leaves a more favourable impression on others. Therefore, choose your approach wisely, considering the situation's specific demands.

I started my career at L&T on the Delhi T3 project after completing my engineering degree. During my time at L&T, I worked under different managers, each with their managerial style. One key difference I noticed was how their approach to work affected the pace of work.

Most of my managers had a constant focus on raising expectations and setting difficult targets to be achieved every week, causing stress and a feeling of never being able to catch up.

However, the last manager I worked under wanted us to focus on getting the basics right for any new work we commenced, slowly improving them every week. We were given enough time at the start of any new work to understand the basics in detail, which helped us avoid future errors. This approach led to us meeting our targets with ease, without the added stress.

As I moved across multiple organisations and now as an entrepreneur, I have realised that focusing on the basics always helps me get work done better and faster, instead of constantly raising the bar to achieve more.

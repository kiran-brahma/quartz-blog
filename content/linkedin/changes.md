Have you ever noticed that we mostly tend to make changes or improvements when things are going bad, instead of when things are going well? This is a common trend that we see in businesses as well. When the economy is struggling or a business is facing challenges, cost control becomes the focus. However, when times are good, we forget to analyze if there is room to reduce costs without sacrificing growth opportunities or even try to understand what driving growth.

The COVID lockdown taught me the advantages of having a lean operations setup. My dad started the business with little money, so we always kept our cost structure lean to ensure [[gross-margins-business|survivability]]. Even as our revenue has increased over the past 5 years, the team continued with the same mentality. This philosophy allowed us to navigate the 40% drop in monthly revenue for over 6 months during the COVID lockdown without any major issues.

Looking back, I am glad that we sustained our habit of keeping costs low even when there was no real need to do so.

We spend days working on a proposal, only to have it decided by your customer or manager within minutes.  We all agree it's quite common. Often, decisions are made basis **perceived confidence**. You are mostly assessed on your verbal behaviour 

**Communication is a two-way street**. It's not just what you say, but how you say it. Your voice tone, speed, and volume all play a part. Speak confidently, and you're more likely to get the results you want. I've seen this in sales pitches, team meetings, and even casual chats with my boss.

**I learned this the hard way**. Missed promotions, lost sales, and failed job interviews â€“ all because of how I was speaking and due to my work. I underestimated the power of my voice. Sometimes I rush through things, and people ask me to repeat myself. Even if they heard the words, I have lost the confidence from the other person

**Changing how you speak can be tough**. But next time you talk to your manager, try to understand what they see as confident communication. Adjust your approach, and you might be surprised by the positive results. Focus on speaking with confidence, not just hoping your good work gets noticed.
